# Description	

Pocket Monster of the Week is a Monster of the Week reskin with custom playbooks and a few rules changes.
Players must figure out how to defeat unbeatable Legendary Pokemon by overcoming actual bugs in Pokemon Red, Blue, Green and Yellow. If they fail the power in the cartridge's battery will deplete and the saved game will be deleted. 

## Character creation changes

A player picks a Pokemon corresponding to the Playbook "Type" they have selected. For example a player could play a Pikachu and would select the "Electric" playbook.

Each player picks 1 Ability, 2 Moves and 3 Attacks from their playbook.

## Attacking

Special attack ![](Playbooks/images/special.png): Uses **Special**. **Special Defense** reduces harm the same way as Armor did.

Psychical attack ![](Playbooks/images/physical.png): Uses **Tough**. **Defense** reduces harm the same way as Armor did.

Status attack ![](Playbooks/images/status.png): Does not require a stat roll to use and often doesn't deal damage.

On the roll of a 10+ with an attack, the attack is a critical hit and deals +1 harm.

## Effectiveness charts

If an attack hit another Pokemon with a type that the attack is "Super Effective" against, the attack deals +1 harm.

If the attack is "Not Very Effective" it deals -1 harm.

If the attack is "Not Effective" it can not deal harm or cause secondary effects.

Moves and Passives added by an Attack are not effected by the effectiveness chart.

## Items

Pokemon can only hold one item at a time (including key items).

Here are some examples.

* Standard Berry - Heals 1 harm and is consumed
* Miracle Berry - Heals any status condition and is consumed
* Gem - Deals 1 extra harm on hit and is consumed
* Mail - A letter

Pokemon do not start with an item, unless their playbook states that they do.

## Misc Character creation

* During character creation roll 5d6. If you roll all the same number, your Pokemon is shiny. Has no effect on stats, but could be mentioned by other Pokemon

* Also pick a level between 15 to 30 (inclusive). It has no effect on your stats, but could matter somehow

* If you pokemon Species can fly (and is not already get the passive **Flying**), you replace your first passive with the following passive.

> **Lesser Flying** You can fly freely up to 10ft. Beyond that, you may also atempt to fly in (but only in resonable conditions) by rolling **Cool**

> 10+ You can fly to where you want to go  
> 7-9: You fly with some trouble. Either you don't quite get to where you are going or it takes you a long time.  
> Miss: you fail fantastically and end up somewhere you donâ€™t want to be
