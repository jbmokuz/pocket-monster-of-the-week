# Pocket Monster of the Week

# Premise

You are Pokemon in the legendary Pokemon trainer Red's team! You have gone on many fantastic Pokemon adventures over the years. However once in a while Red would seemingly "freeze" in place for no reason. At first this was for just a few hours a day. However, as time went on, these "freezing" periods got longer and longer, until it seemed to just go on for years.

Finally	after being stuck in your pokeball for ages, you escape into a vastly changed world! Pokemon fear that the end is near as the great "Energizer's" power wanes. In an effort to conserve	power Pokemon do not fight. But with your awakening also heralds monstrous Legendary Pokemon called "The Game Sharks" with unfathomable power and a thrust for consuming energy. Only you posses the Hidden Machine's to stop The Game Sharks! Will you be able to stop them before all of Kanto is erased forever?

# Description	

Pocket Monster of the Week is a Monster of the Week reskin with custom playbooks and a few rules changes.
Players must figure out how to defeat unbeatable Legendary Pokemon by overcoming actual bugs in Pokemon Red, Blue, Green and Yellow. If they fail the power in the cartridge's battery will deplete and the saved game will be deleted. 

## Character creation changes

A player picks a Pokemon corresponding to the Playbook "Type" they have selected. For example a player could play a Pikachu and would select the "Electric" playbook.

Each Playbook has a number of passive abilities described in the "Ability" section.

Each playbook has 6 Attacks. The PC is required to pick the first Attack (designated with a *) and then picks 3 out of the remaining attacks, for a total of 4 attacks.

Some attacks add a move or a passive ability to the players playbook. The player must have picked the corresponding attack to take to be able to use the move or gain the passive ability.

## Stats Reskin

Cute = Charm

Cool = Cool

Clever = Sharp

Tough = Tough

Special = Weird

## Kick Some Ass change

Kick Some Ass is not longer a move. Instead each Attack has a type that dictates what skill to use.

Special attack ![](Playbooks/images/special.png): Uses **Special** (Reskined Weird). **Special Defense** reduces harm the same way as Armor did.

Psychical attack ![](Playbooks/images/physical.png): Uses **Tough** (Reskined Tough). **Defense** reduces harm the same way as Armor did.

Status attack ![](Playbooks/images/status.png): Does not require a stat roll to use and often doesn't deal damage. 

On the roll of a 10+ with an attack, the player is said to have gotten a critical hit and deals +1 harm. There is no longer the ability to chose an extra effect on a success.

## Effectiveness charts

If an attack hit another Pokemon with a type that the attack is "Super Effective" against, the attack deals +1 harm.

If the attack is "Not Very Effective" it deals -1 harm.

If the attack is "Not Effective" it can not deal harm or cause secondary effects.

Moves and Passives added by an Attack are not effected by the effectiveness chart.

## Items

Pokemon can only hold one item at a time (including key items).

* Standard Berry - Heals 1 harm and is consumed
* Miracle Berry - Heals any status condition and is consumed
* Gem - Deals 1 extra harm on hit and is consumed
* Mail - A letter

## Shiny Pokemon

* During character creation roll 2d20s. If you roll 2 nat 20s, your Pokemon is shiny. Has no effect on stats, but could be mentioned by other Pokemon
