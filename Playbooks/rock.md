### Description (Physical Attacker)

Do you just want to punch things really hard? Well then look no further. **Rock** and **Fighting** Pokemon must beware of **Ghost** Pokemon, as they may have a hard time hitting them. Also there biggest attacks are physical, so they can have problems with **Special Defense** if they don't take **Ancient Power.**

All you need is **Tough** to punch all the things! **Clever** can be used with **Ancient Power**

**Rock** Pokemon have a bit more survivability while **Fighting** Pokemon can hit things even harder.
