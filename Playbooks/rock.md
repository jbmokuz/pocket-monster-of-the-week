### Description

Do you just want to punch things really hard? All you need is **Tough** to punch all the things! **Rock** Pokemon have a bit more survivability while Fighting Pokemon can hit things even harder. Beware of **Ghost** Pokemon, as you may have a hard time hitting them. Also you biggest attacks are physical so you can have problems with **Special Defense** if you don't take **Ancient Power.**
