### Description (Support)

While at first glance, normal Pokemon are the model support type Pokemon. However they have the ability to pick a move from any playbook, giving them a little flavor of what ever they want to be! They also have no required move, giving them more flexibility.

**Cute** is prominently featured in there abilities. Otherwise it depends on what move they happen to take from another playbook.
