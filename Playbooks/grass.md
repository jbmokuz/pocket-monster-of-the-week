### Description (Generalist)

**Grass** and **Bug** Pokemon are kind of a mixed bag. There are alot of options, but perhaps nothing too single foucused. They also have by far the best status effect move. 

**Grass** pokemon can have amazing survivability if they have a source of healing. **Bug** pokemon are good at finding hiden things and have better crits.

They use **Tough** to precisely cut and also move Pokemon around where they want them. Also **Cool** can be used for good first impressions
