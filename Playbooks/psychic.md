### Description (Utility caster)

Psychic Pokemon have many extremely useful abilities. They can sense the future and tap into other Pokemon's minds. However they are absolutely terrible in a fight.

**Special** is the most important stat for a Psychic Pokemon.

### Ability

**Telepathy:** you can read people’s thoughts and put words in their mind. This can allow you to **Investigate a Mystery** or **Read  a  Bad  Situation**  without needing to actually talk. You can also manipulate someone without speaking. You still roll moves as normal, except people will not expect the weirdness of your mental communication.
